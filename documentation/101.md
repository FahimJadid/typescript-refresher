### TypeScript Refresher - 101

# What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools.
- TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript alternative that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java.
- TypeScript is an strongly typed language which builds on JavaScript giving you better tooling at any scale.
- Allowing us to use ES6 features like classes, arrow functions, and modules, while still providing the safety of types.
- Extra features like enums, interfaces, generics, and more.

# Why TypeScript?

- In production, JavaScript code can become difficult to maintain because of the lack of type declarations, which leads to errors when trying to use the code in other applications. TypeScript solves this problem by allowing developers to use type declarations and compile the code to JavaScript. In addition, TypeScript provides extra features such as enums, interfaces, generics, and more. Typescript does not use dynamic typing, but rather, static typing. This means that variables can be defined to have a type, such as a string or a number, and that type cannot be changed. This allows for better code quality and fewer bugs.
